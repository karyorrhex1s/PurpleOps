# PurpleOps — Logbook

Author: karyorrhex1s  
Purpose: public, reproducible defense-focused research notes. Each entry is structured as:
- ATT&CK mapping
- Threat emulation description (how to reproduce)
- Observed telemetry (artifacts, logs)
- Detection rules (Sigma, osquery, YARA ideas, Wazuh/Elastic rule pseudo)
- Automated mitigation & playbook
- Postmortem / lessons learned

Why
- Turn laboratory intuition into repeatable, hireable signal.
- Show both offensive skill (emulation) and defensive engineering (detections, automation).
- Each entry is a standalone mini-research note that can be read within 3–8 minutes.

Contribute
- Follow the template in `/templates/entry-template.md`.
- Make PRs with small, focused entries. Use issues for new TTP proposals.
