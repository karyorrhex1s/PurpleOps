# PurpleOps — Public Threat Research Logbook

**Lab-based adversary emulation. Real detection engineering. Open-source defender intelligence.**  
Live, versioned research into offensive TTPs + detection logic + operational mitigation playbooks.

### What’s inside
Realistic adversary emulation (lab — safe & isolated)  
Observed telemetry (DFIR clarity — process, file, network traces)  
Detection engineering (Sigma, osquery, YARA scaffolds)  
Operational IR playbooks (defender actions, not just theory)

**This site will evolve as the logbook publishes live TTP entries.**  
Built for purple-team detection engineering — not hypothetical analysis.
